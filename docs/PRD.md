# Tonnage - MVP
## Product Requirements Document
By Mikey Petty

### Goals and Objectives
The goal of Tonnage is to provide a free and easy way to for Gym Rats to track workouts over time. The philosophy is simple: provide a batteries included app that is easy to use on while sitting on the bench AND allows for maximal customization. We want you to be able to track your workouts regardless of your goals. Simple, easy to use, and as complex as you want

### Stakeholders
- Users of the Application, Gym Rats
- Mikey Petty, development cost

### Assumptions
- Gym Rats want a simple to use tool with the ability to track workouts over time
- Gym Rats want the ability to configure as much about the tool as possible, but not be forced to do so
- Gym Rats do not need to be hand held through the process of creating a workout plan
- Gym Rats want the tool to be seamless and obvious to use without much guidance 

### User (Gym Rat) Stories
As a Gym Rat, I want to download this onto my phone and start tracking my workout without needing a tutorial

As a Gym Rat, I want to see how much total weight I lifted (tonnage) after I complete a workout.

As a Gym Rat, I want to see metrics on my lifts over time.

As a Gym Rat, I want the app to track my 1RM on various exercises. I want the app to automatically calculate my 1RM based off of a previous set or sets.

As a Gym Rat, I want the ability to create complex workouts using a variety of set tracking methods, including: supersets, warm-up sets, drop-sets, and AMRAP sets.

As a Gym Rat, I want an extensive default list of movements and exercises. I want to be able to add custom notes and cues to these exercises for reference later. 

As a Gym Rat, I want the ability to add custom exercises.

As a Gym Rat, I want the ability to add modifiers to various exercises, including: grip width, grip orientation, range of motion, weight type (machine, dumbbell, etc...), straps used, foot stance, and incline / decline angle. I also want the ability to add custom modifiers to my workouts.

### Feature Requirements

### Design
*Add screenshots with UI mockups*

### Out of Scope
In this initial step, we should avoid the following
- Gym Rats cannot add modifiers to custom exercises
- Gym Rats cannot create an account or sign in
- Gym Rats cannot track all types of sets: circuits, myoreps, partial reps, rest-pause sets, etc...
- Gym Rats cannot merge duplicate exercises

### Open Questions
- How much flexibility do Gym Rats want on tracking their sets? Are partial reps, rest-pause sets, circuits, etc... important?
- How important is it for users to sign up? Is there a significant cost to storing the data on a user's device?
- What are the best, obvious defaults for users of the app?
